# ToxProxy

As of yet mostly just a copy of the EchoBot from
<https://wiki.tox.chat/developers/client_examples/echo_bot>

Zoff and me are currently working on making this ToxProxy work together with the Android Tox client TriFa to support usage of a Proxy to be able to only periodically check for messages on battery powered devices to reduce power and network usage.
